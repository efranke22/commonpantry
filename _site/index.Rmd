Hi! This page is meant to summarize Common Pantry's van usage. Between **November 2020** and **July 8, 2021**, the Common Pantry van has been driven **620.8** miles (and there are **1791.7** miles on the van total). We will look at the data from November through the end of June, during which the van has traveled **603** miles.

```{r, include = FALSE}
#van mileage
vans %>%
  summarize(sum(Distance, na.rm = TRUE))

#van mileage - July
vans %>%
  filter(month !="July") %>%
  summarize(sum(Distance, na.rm = TRUE))
```

<span style='color:forestgreen; font-size:150%; font-weight:600'> Common Pantry Van Miles per Month <span>

Common Pantry's van traveled the most miles in **March** and **May 2021** with over 100 miles each month. **35.5** of the **101.9** miles in March came from a trip to and from **Winnetka Congregational Church** for a donation pickup. **73.1** of the **118.5** miles driven in May resulted from traveling to and from **Matteson Prairie**. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vans %>%
  filter(Date <= "2021-06-30") %>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  summarize(miles_driven = round(sum(Distance, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %>% #mean miles: 75.38
  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=miles_driven)) +
  geom_col(fill = "forestgreen")+
  geom_text(aes(label = miles_driven), size = 3, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 3, position = "stack", color = "white")+
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot", 
        plot.title = element_markdown(family = "mono", face = "bold", size = 14, color = "forestgreen"),

#sum(vans$Distance, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Without the trips to WCC and Matteson Prairie, the distribution of miles driven per month is adjusted below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  filter(Date <= "2021-06-30", 
         Location != "Matteson Prairie", 
         `Prior Location` != "Matteson Prairie",

         `Prior Location` != "WCC - Winnetka") %>%

##### Here is what each category represents. Additionally, check out the table below for the exact monthly mileages to and from each destination category. 

**Grocery**: miles driven to and from Aldi, Harvestime, Jewel, and Whole Foods \

**Pick-up**: miles driven to pick up donations from donor homes and organizations (such as Cradles 2 Crayons, Ravenswood Elementary, Share Our Spare, and more), as well as to pick up additional items for clients (for example, First Slice, Restaurant Depot, and Metro Montrose Community Gardens). 

**Random**: this counts mileage for several random trips the van was used for, including to and from Staples, Ace Hardware, Matteson Prairie, the car wash, and any trips with a missing location. 

**Garage-pantry**: solely counts the mileage the van traveled between Common Pantry and the garage. 

**Drop-off**: miles driven to drop of donations. This includes Salvation Army, Friendship Center, RCS, Concordia, Swedish, and more.
